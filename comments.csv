863,"Bad car for day-to-day use. The fuel consumption is high and the comfort to get in and out of the car is zero due to the height of the car. It is also a very delicate car, as any bump in the road can damage the car on a large scale due to a small pothole. On the other hand, it is not suitable for hilly terrain, as it has a very low suspension. It also makes too much noise when accelerating a little.",1

One of the highlights of the car is the great system inside, it has many features available such as hands-free operation, voice control, route calculation at any time of the journey, etc. It also stands out for its acceleration, as soon as you accelerate fully, it exerts so much force that you are glued to the seat without being able to move and seeing how the car goes from 0 to 100 in just 3 seconds, it's an incredible sensation.",3
